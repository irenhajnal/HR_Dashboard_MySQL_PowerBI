### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initiaal data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Cleaning

### Data Analysis in SQL
1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?

### Data Visualization

#### KPIâ€™s
The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the sales data. This enables users to make informed decisions, monitor their progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
  1. Sales Overview:
      - Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
      - Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales
      - Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
      - Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales
  2. Average Price Analysis:
      - YTD Average Price
      - MTD Average Price
      - YOY Growth in Average Price
      - Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price
  3. Cars Sold Metrics:
      - YTD Cars Sold
      - MTD Cars Sold
      - YOY Growth in Cars Sold
      - Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold

  6.	Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information: A detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.

I used advanced DAX Functions

Include some interesting code/features worked with. Here we include if we used subquery, cte, window function, etc.

```sql 
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE cond = 2;
```
